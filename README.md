# Introduction to programming 2

## Installing

When you first open the project, you need to run cmake three times.

`Error: Could NOT find SDL2 (missing: SDL2_LIBRARY SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR)`


for some reason cmake can't find the SDL2 libs on the first two tries, but it works after.

So just run cmake three times.

### Windows

* everything included in the CLion IDE
